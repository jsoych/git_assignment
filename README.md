    > e. What is the difference between `git` and `GitHub`?

    `git` is a version control system, and `GitHub` is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories.

    > f. What does `git diff` do?

    `git diff` display the differences (diffs) between the content in the source branch and the content in the target branch.

    > g. What is the `main` branch?

    The `main` branch is the main line of development. The main line of development is reserved for the code used in production.

    > h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the `main` branch?

    No, for each change we make to our codebase, it's best to create a branch specific to that collection of changes. Once a branch is made, we can push our changes to that branch.
